# Welcome to Journal App

We're thrilled to have you here! Whether you're new to journaling or a seasoned writer, Journal App is designed to make your reflection practice effortless, warm, and meaningful.

## Why We Built This

In our fast-paced world, it's easy to lose touch with ourselves. We created Journal App as a gentle space where you can pause, reflect, and reconnect with what truly matters.

### What Makes Journal App Different

**Warm & Inviting Design**  
We believe your journaling space should feel like a cozy corner of your favorite café. That's why we've crafted every detail with warm colors, friendly typography, and smooth interactions that make writing a joy.

**Mood-First Approach**  
Track not just what happened, but how you felt. Our mood calendar gives you a visual snapshot of your emotional journey, helping you spot patterns and celebrate growth.

**Privacy by Design**  
Your thoughts are precious and private. We use industry-standard JWT authentication to ensure your entries stay yours and yours alone.

## Getting Started

1. **Create your account** - It takes just a minute
2. **Write your first entry** - There's no wrong way to start
3. **Track your mood** - Pick an emoji that captures how you feel
4. **Make it a habit** - Even 5 minutes a day can make a difference

## What's Next

We're constantly improving Journal App based on your feedback. In the coming months, we'll be adding:

- Rich text formatting for more expressive entries
- Photo attachments to capture visual memories
- Prompts and templates to inspire your writing
- Insights and analytics to understand your patterns

Thank you for being part of our community. Here's to clarity, growth, and quieter, more joyful moments.

Happy journaling! 📔
